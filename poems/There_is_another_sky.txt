The cows are going to pasture and little boys with their hands in their pockets are whistling to keep them warm. Dont think that the sky will frown so the day when you come home! She will smile and look happy, and be full of sunshine then - and even should she frown upon her child returning,
there is another sky
ever serene and fair,
and there is another sunshine,
tho' it be darkness there -
never mind faded forets, Austin,
never mind silent fields -here is a little forest
whose leaf is ever green -
here is a brighter garden -
where not a frost has been,
in its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum,
prithee, my Brother,
into my garden come!
