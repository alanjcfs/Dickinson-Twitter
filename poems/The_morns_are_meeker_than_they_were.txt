The morns are meeker than they were -
The nuts are getting brown -
The berry's cheek is plumper -
The Rose is out of town -
The maple wears a gayer scarf -
The field - a scarlet gown -
Lest I sh'd seem old fashioned
I'll put a trinket on!

The morns are meeker than they were —
The nuts are getting brown —
The berry's cheek is plumper —
The Rose is out of town.
The Maple wears a gayer scarf —
The field a scarlet gown —
Lest I should be old fashioned
I'll put a trinket on.
