My Wheel is in the dark.
I cannot see a spoke -
Yet know it's dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the tide -
An unfrequented road
Yet have all roads
A "Clearing" at the end.
Some have resigned the Loom -
Some - in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ.
Some with new - stately feet
Pass royal thro' the gate
Flinging the problem back, at you and I.

My Wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know it's dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road -
Yet have all roads
A "Clearing" at the end -
Some have resigned the Loom -
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ -
Some with new - stately feet -
Pass royal thro' the gate -
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!

My wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road —
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end —
Some have resigned the Loom —
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ —
Some with new — stately feet —
Pass royal through the gate —
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!
