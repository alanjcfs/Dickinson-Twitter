Morns like these - we parted
Noons like these - she rose!
Fluttering first - then firmer
To her fair repose -
Never did she lisp it
And 'twas not for me -
She was mute for transport
I, for agony!
Till the evening nearing
One the shutters drew -
Quick! a sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!

Morns like these - we parted.
Noons like these - she rose
Fluttering first - then firmer -
To her fair repose.
Never did she lisp it -
And 'twas not for me -
She was mute from transport -
I - from agony -
Till - the evening nearing -
One the Curtains drew -
Quick! A sharper rustling!
And this Linnet flew!

Morns like these — we parted —
Noons like these — she rose —
Fluttering first — then firmer
To her fair repose.
Never did she lisp it —
It was not for me —
She — was mute from transport —
I — from agony —
Till — the evening nearing
One the curtains drew —
Quick! A Sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!
