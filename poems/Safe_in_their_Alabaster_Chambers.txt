Safe in their Alabaster Chambers —
Untouched by Morning And untouched by Noon —
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection —
Rafter of satin, And Roof of stone.
Light laughs the breeze
In her Castle above them —
Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear,
Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence —
Ah, what sagacity perished here!
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
Diadems drop and Doges surrender, Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.
