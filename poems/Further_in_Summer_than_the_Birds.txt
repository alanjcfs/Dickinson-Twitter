Further in Summer than the Birds -
Pathetic from the Grass -
A Minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass -
No Ordinance be seen -
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness -
'Tis Audiblest, at Dusk -
When Day's attempt is done -
And Nature nothing waits to do
But terminate in Tune -
Nor difference it knows
Of Cadence, or of Pause -
But simultaneous as Same -
The Service emphacize -
Nor know I when it cease -
At Candles, it is here -
When Sunrise is - that it is not -
Than this, I know no more -
The Earth has many keys -
Where Melody is not
Is the Unknown Peninsula -
Beauty - is Nature's Fact -
But Witness for Her Land -
And Witness for Her Sea -
The Cricket is Her utmost
Of Elegy, to Me -

Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass
No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness.
Antiquer felt at Noon
When August is burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify
Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic - Difference
Enhances Nature now
