This is a Dickinson Twitter.

wikisource-retriever.rb was used to retrieve all the poems listed in
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Emily_Dickinson_poems);
it turned out that the list was not completely accurate, resulting in several
hundreds missing poems. Many of the errors were corrected by adding dashes 
at the end of each file using retrieve_missing_poems.rb.

Because em dash requires Unicode support, the magic comment *# encoding: UTF-8*
is added.

oauth_configure.rb was added to .gitignore to keep consumer_secret and
oauth_token_secret confidential.
